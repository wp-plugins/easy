Easy, but complex GUI website builder.

== Description ==

This widgets doesn't not do much at this point. But give me a month, and you won't live without it.
This widget is a new much better version then its ancestor <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/2046s-widget-loops/">2046's loop widget</a> which serves as a the testing platform, before the real thing comes.
"Easy" will have all it's ancestors functions plus many more and ofcourse your own! 
It is done in extensible way. So that anybody can plug in their own object with its own function and use the Drag&Drop power of this widget to his own needs. As for now there is no closer explanation how, but wait, it has been just born!

The widget scaffolding structure is based on the <a href="http://twitter.github.com/">Bootstrap</a> logic. If you do not know Bootstrap, than don't miss the train!
